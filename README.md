## Executive Summary
Looking to improve your online sales? Interested to know how it can be done? Our team, NutCrack, which focuses on Recommender System might just be able to help you with that problem.

We are focusing to leverage on the ever-changing technology in order to help online stores and companies increase their sales. Many companies boast the large amount of products they have but some were not able to make much sales and that is the problem we want to solve. With technology such as Artificial Intelligence, more could be done in this digitalized world. By having a Recommender System integrated to your website, you can have a higher conversion rate because your potential customers will be introduced to products they may like.

NutCrack is a sole proprietor firm and is home-based in the north. We have also been operating since August 2016. You can contact us to discuss further if you find our proposal suitable for your company.
